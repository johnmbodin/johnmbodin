- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnmbodin (I am not a tehnologist)
- 👀 I am working on a start-up Platform Co-op (forum.coop) that will provide member/patron communities an OS Deliberative Democracy Utility (E2EV Meeting/Polling/Voting) meant to improve self-governance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to best provide a 'Data Trust' environment that would provide fiduciary oversight over this Utility's SSID-driven membership data stream...could be part of the Co-op or a 3rd Party DAO (?) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet others (especially technologists) who would be interested in discussing a collaboration to explore how this 'Data Fiduciary' entity might take real-world shape to best provide the Co-op (and any other interested organization or comnnunity) with a 3rd party (OS) platform upon which it could provide self-sovereign data governance to its cohort of members. 
- 📫 How to reach me: john@form.coop
