- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnmbodin (I am not a tehnologist)
- 👀 I am working on a start-up a Platform Co-op (forum.coop) to provide member/patron communities an OS Deliberative Democracy Utility (E2EV Meeting/Polling/Voting)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to best provide a 'Data Trust' environment that would provide fiduciary oversight over this Utility's SSID-driven membership data stream...probably a DAO 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exploring how this 3rd Party DAO might take formation to best spin up a Data Trust as a Service (DTaaS) that would provide the Co-op (an any other interested organization or comnnunity) with a 3rd party (OS) platform upon which it could provide this Fiduciary service (for its own cohort data). 
- 📫 How to reach me: john@form.coop
